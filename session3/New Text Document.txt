1.How to check variable's type ?
print(type(variable))
2.In what cases, you will get SyntaxError from the compiler telling you that some of your variables have invalid names? Can you give 3 different examples of invalid names?
+ The assignment token, =, should not be confused with equals, which uses the token ==. The assignment statement binds a name, on the left-hand side of the operator, to a value, on the

+ There are some situations in which names beginning with an underscore have special meaning,
so a safe rule for beginners is to start all names with a letter.
Example:
1. >>> 17 = n
File "<interactive input>", line 1
SyntaxError: can’t assign to literal
2. >>> 76trombones = "big parade"
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
3. >>> more$ = 1000000
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
